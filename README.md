## User stories
- As a player, I want to touch/click the first color to request a valid (treasure) location.
- As a player, I want to hear confirmation that a location has been selected (so I can I can begin searching). 
- As a player, I want to touch/click the second color:  If I am outside the treasure location, I want to hear information to help me find the treasure location (clue? how far away? what direction to walk?)
- As a player, I want to touch/click the second color: If I am inside the treasure location, I want to hear and see confirmation that I have earned this treasure.
- As a player, after confirmation that I have earned a location: I want the game to ask me if I would like to select another location. If I select yes, we reset and begin again.
