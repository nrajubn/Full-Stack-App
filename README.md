# group5-Fullstack-app

Welcome to 'The Hunt', a full-stack location-based game app.

## Published App: https://nrajubn.github.io/Full-Stack-App/ 
## Heroku Link : https://fullstack-group5.herokuapp.com/ 

## Overview 
- A location-based gaming application that assists the user in finding the treasure. 
- It first compares the device's coordinates to the target position and informs the user whether he or she is inside or outside of it. 
- When the user clicks/touches the first color, it displays a correct treasure location and also a confirmation message stating that a specific location has been chosen will appear.
- Even after confirmation, the user is given the option to choose a different spot, and if so, the game can be restarted from the beginning.
- Whether the user is inside the treasure location and selects or touches the second color, the user will hear information that a treasure has been won; if the user is outside the target location, the user will hear information about help in finding a treasure like direction to walk, how far away from it, or any other clue.

## User stories
